# kitsu.cafe
This is the repository for my personal website. It acts as a blog and a portfolio.

# Usage
Clone this repo and compile with [Roxy](https://github.com/kitsunecafe/roxy).

```sh
roxy -l layouts -c content -t Flatron.tmTheme -o dist
```

Alternatively, use `./start.sh` to start a development server using a `python` web server. These scripts were developed for my Arch environment so they may or may not work anywhere else.
